Slide 2: How Do We Learn?
Learning is Pattern Recognition.

As humans, we don't memorize every single cat we see. We see a few, form a concept of "cat-ness" (whiskers, fur, paws), and then can recognize millions of new cats we've never seen.

We learn from experience and feedback. We make a mistake, we correct our mental model.

What if a machine could do the same? What if instead of being programmed with rigid rules, it could learn the rules itself from data?

Slide 3: The Dream of a Learning Machine
The idea of an artificial brain has fascinated us for centuries.

But how do you actually build one?

In 1958, a psychologist named Frank Rosenblatt at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory created the first practical design for a learning machine. He called it the Perceptron.

It wasn't just a program; it was custom-built hardware, funded by the US Navy, meant to be the "brain" of a ship-guiding computer that could learn to recognize enemies.

Slide 4: The Perceptron: A Model of a Neuron
Rosenblatt was inspired by biology. He modeled his machine after a simple brain neuron.

The Core Idea: A neuron takes in signals, decides if they are strong enough, and then "fires" an output signal.

The Perceptron does the same thing mathematically:

Inputs (X1, X2...): The raw data. (e.g., Pixels of an image, sensor readings).

Weights (W1, W2...): The importance of each input. This is what the machine learns.

Summation (Î£): Adds up all (Input * Weight). The total "evidence."

Bias (b): A learned tendency to say "yes" or "no" before seeing any evidence. Like a predisposition.

Activation Function: The decision rule. "Is the total evidence strong enough?" If (Sum + Bias) > 0, output 1 (YES), else output 0 (NO).

Slide 5: How Does It Learn? The Perceptron Learning Rule
This is Rosenblatt's genius. The machine starts with random weights (guessing).

It makes a prediction on a data point.

If correct: It does nothing. "My weights are good for this example."

If wrong: It nudges its weights and bias.

Nudge Rule: New Weight = Old Weight + (Learning Rate * Input * Error)

This simple, mechanical process is repeated thousands of times. With each mistake, the weights get a little better.

Rosenblatt proved: If a solution exists, this rule will find it.

Slide 6: The "Dividing Line" & Perceptron Space
What is the Perceptron actually learning? A rule. This rule is visualized as a dividing line.

Imagine plotting your data on a graph. The perceptron's job is to draw a straight line that separates, for example, "Cats" from "Dogs."

The learned weights and bias define the slope and position of this line.

Why is this a revolution? We didn't code the rule "if whisker_length > 5 then cat." The machine discovered the rule itself by finding the best possible dividing line through trial and error.

Slide 7: The Flaw: The Limitation of a Single Line
In 1969, AI pioneers Marvin Minsky & Seymour Papert published a devastating critique.

They proved mathematically that a single perceptron has a fatal flaw: it can only learn rules that can be separated by a single straight line. These are called linearly separable problems.

The Classic Example: The XOR Problem

Rule: Output 1 if the inputs are different, Output 0 if they are the same.

Input 1	Input 2	Output
0	0	0
0	1	1
1	0	1
1	1	0
Try to draw one straight line to separate the 0s from the 1s. You can't. This simple problem is impossible for a single perceptron.

Slide 8: The AI Winter
Minsky and Papert's book, Perceptrons, was so influential it convinced the world that neural networks were a dead end.

Funding dried up. Research stopped. This period, known as the AI Winter, lasted for over a decade.

The dream of a learning machine was put on ice.

Slide 9: The Revival: A Solution Through Layers
The solution was hinted at in Minsky and Papert's own book: use more than one perceptron!

The idea: Stack perceptrons in layers.

First Layer: Multiple perceptrons, each learning a simple, single line.

Second Layer: A perceptron that takes the outputs of the first layer as its inputs. It learns to combine their simple lines into a more complex shape.

This architecture is called a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) or a neural network.

Slide 10: Solving XOR with Layers
How does a network solve XOR?

First Layer: Two perceptrons. One learns the line "Input 1 > Input 2". The other learns "Input 2 > Input 1".

These two lines create a new representation of the data.

Second Layer: A final perceptron takes these new inputs and learns to combine them to create the correct XOR output. It draws a new line in this new, transformed space.

Visual:

Show the original XOR plot with two lines from the hidden layer neurons creating three regions.

Show how the final neuron can now draw a line to separate the classes in this new representation.

Slide 11: How to Train This Beast? Backpropagation!
But there was a new problem: How do you train the first layer? Rosenblatt's rule only worked for the final output.

The breakthrough was the Backpropagation algorithm (1980s).

The Idea: Use calculus (the chain rule) to calculate how much each weight in the entire network, even the very first one, contributed to the final error.

It's like the learning rule, but it can propagate the error backward through all the layers, efficiently adjusting every single weight.

Gradient Descent: This is the optimization process that uses these error calculations to find the best weights by slowly "walking downhill" on a landscape of error.

Slide 12: The Spark of Modern AI
The combination of Multi-Layer Networks + Backpropagation was the spark that reignited the field.

It provided both the structure (to represent complex ideas) and the learning mechanism (to train that structure).

This core invention is the foundation of every modern AI system, from the voice assistant on your phone to the largest language models like ChatGPT.

It all started with a simple model of a neuron and the dream of a machine that could learn.
